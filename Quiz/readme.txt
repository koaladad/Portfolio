Under construction, quiz.py needs to be updated. does not register correct % yet.

How to use:
(using Python27) in cmd prompt, under correct directory => python quiz.py
enter text.txt when prompted for a text file (this is the tutorial file)
enter number of questions you want for random quiz (10 is fine)
